## Stumbling Blocks
After receiving my initial score of 85 for Accessibility, I found that it was due to color contrast issues and button spacing/clickability. Originally the issue with the contrast was between the background and the font colors I had used, and with the tool Lighthouse linked to compare contrast for accessbility, I was able to change them to be suitable. However, an issue that arose after for color contrast was within the buttons in my Navigation; since I made them linked to the separate sections of the page, the link colors had bad contrast ratings against the color of the button. I was not able to fix this issue, as I tried to code around the link color by different means (i.e. for the original text, the color when the link has been clicked, etc.). The other factor with the buttons was that they were spaced/sized in a non-accessible way. Try as I might by increasing the size of the font as well as spacing the buttons, the score of my accessibility was not impacted. I was able to raise my SEO score to 100 after adding the meta description of the page. I think some of my issues with the formatting may be solved once I learn more about CSS.
